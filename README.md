# tetris-java
I made this game back in November 2015, during the long Thanksgiving weekend.

This is your average, simple Tetris game. The different pieces are each represented in their own classes. Each extends abstract TetrisShape, which contains a skeletal implementation of a Tetris piece.
The main class is Tetris.java. It controls all the high level logic.

To run: Just download out/Tetris.jar and run it! Very simple.
